## What is it?
This is a NAT A guidance program running on a server in a public network environment. It can use WebHook submission from STUN NAT traversal tools such as Lucky to redirect users to the NAT A address location of the server based on the bound domain name. Just like Synology QuickConnect NAT A processing. 

## How to use it?
At this stage, we do not recommend immediate production use as potential vulnerabilities have not been ruled out and the functionality has not been fully developed.
